Today is September 13, 2023. My "Girlfriend" tried to tell me she has no idea where i'm going to be in life. It sounds like she's doubting me
and i don't like being doubted. So here i'm going to pledge to myself that i WILL make it far into my programming journey, and i will land a 
very successful job to better my future, to not only prove her and all the other people who doubt me wrong, but to prove to myself that i can 
accomplish anything whenever i want to.
